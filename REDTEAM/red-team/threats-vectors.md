# Threats Vectors

## Malware Vectors

> Malicious code written to interfere with Computer operations and cause damage to Data and software, Which Wait for particular events to get triggers OR User interactive after the purpose is fulfilled it goes to the original places.&#x20;

> &#x20;Malware is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malwares. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.   &#x20;

> Malware: Software designed to harm devices or networks.&#x20;

### Types

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Types of Malware.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Computer Virus:

> Computer Virus: Computer Virus is a malicious Pieces of Code which is intended to Harm the entity/ Computer, Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software Computer Virus required User Interaction to Perform Malicious Activity.&#x20;
>
> A virus needs to be initiated by a user (Example. a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.&#x20;

> Story Time  --> Brain Virus: In 1986, the Alvi brothers created the Brain virus, although the intention of the virus was to track illegal copies of medical software and prevent pirated licenses, What the virus actually did was unexpected. Once a person used a pirated copy of the software, The virus-infected that computer. Then, any disk that was Inserted into the computer was also infected. The virus spread to a new computer Every time someone used one of the infected disks. Undetected, the virus Spread globally within a couple of months. Although the intention was not to Destroy data or hardware, The virus slowed down productivity and significantly impacted business operations&#x20;

Today as virus are commonly used and refer to as MALWARE.

#### Worms:

> Worms OR Worms Virus : The worms was not  intended to Warm system in the first place.&#x20;
>
> Warms is a pieces of code which created to identify Numbers of Computers in Networks by replicate itself and goes to unfinded systems then make them known.&#x20;
>
> But didn’t turn out as the intension of worms creators & it start to replicate itself in system which cause of overflow of memory cpu more.&#x20;
>
> Worms: Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.&#x20;
>
> Worms: Malware that self-replicates, spreading across the network and infecting computers&#x20;

> &#x20;
>
> Story Times  -->  the Morris worm: In 1988, Robert Morris developed A program to assess the size of the internet. The program crawled the web and installed itself onto Other computers to tally the number Of computers that were connected to the internet. The program, however, failed to Keep track of the computers it had Already compromised and continued to re-install Itself until the computers ran out of memory and crashed. About 6,000 computers were affected, Representing 10% of the internet at the time. This attack cost millions of dollars in damages due to Business disruptions and the efforts Required to remove the worm.&#x20;

> CERT -->After the Morris worm, Computer Emergency Response Teams, Known as CERTs®, were Established to respond to computer security incidents. CERTs still exist today, But their place in the security industry has Expanded to include more responsibilities&#x20;
>
> Opinion: Don’t understand the morals of nature which is strongest need to protect weakest&#x20;

#### Trojan Horse:

> Trojan Horse : the name Trojan Horse is inspired by the Trojan Horse story which is a King defence is strong to break that enemy of that King build a wooden horse crafted inside of that wooden horse there are soldier . Gifted that wooden horse to king as a gift all the defence of king  is bypass that how they manage to kill the king.&#x20;
>
> That the same way Trojan Horse code works, Trojan Horse is a malicious pieces of code that looks harmless but it not , which waited for the right time OR the right order to execute & harm the system after that it’s come back to the original place and repeat the process.&#x20;

#### KeyLogger :&#x20;

> it’s a malicious pieces of code that records the key strokes of keywords

#### SpyWare:

> Spy (Spying )  ware (software) It’s a malicious pieces of code that records of the data in screen mode.
>
> Spyware: Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices.
>
> This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

#### Adware:

> Advertising software it’s a code which trigger with sets of words which shows the advertisement features for marketing purposes

#### Botware:

> A Code which is pre installed in the application system For Example Makerting Purpose.

#### Ransomware:

> A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.

## Social Engineering

> Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private, access, or valuables Information.
>
> Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question which I do mostly every times. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible.
>
> &#x20;
>
> Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority like me . The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk

#### Why Its works?:

Authority: Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.

Intimidation: Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told.

Consensus/Social proof: Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past.

Scarcity: A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply.

Familiarity: Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.&#x20;

Trust: Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.

Urgency: A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning



### Types of Social Engineering

**Social media phishing**: A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.

**Watering hole attack**: A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.

**USB baiting**: A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.

**Physical social engineering**: A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

**Whaling** : A form of spear phishing during which threat actors target executives in order to gain access to sensitive data

## Phishing&#x20;

Why is Phishing Spelled with a "ph"?

> Hackers commonly replace the letter _f_  with _ph_, as a salute to the original form of hacking known as phone phreaking.&#x20;
>
> Phreaking was coined by John Draper, aka Captain Crunch, who hacked telephone systems in the early 1970s.
>
> Later in the 1990s, a hacked user account was called a _phish_.   Phish were once traded among hackers as a form of currency.
>
> Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.

### Phishing Types

Business Email Compromise (BEC): A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.

Spear phishing: A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.

Whaling: A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.

Vishing: The exploitation of electronic voice communication to o#btain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

Smishing: The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source



## Threats

> Any Circumstances or Events that can negatively impact Assests.

> A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. As an entry-level security analyst, your job is to help defend the organization’s assets from inside and outside threats. Therefore, understanding common types of threats is important to an analyst’s daily work. As a reminder, common threats include:
>
> Insider threats: Staff members or vendors abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.

**Advanced persistent threats (APTs)**: A threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.

## Risks

> A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat. One way to think about this is that a risk is being late to work and threats are traffic, an accident, a flat tire, etc.

### Risk Types

External risk: Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information

Internal risk: A current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk

Legacy systems: Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems. For example, an organization might have an old vending machine that takes credit card payments or a workstation that is still connected to the legacy accounting system.

Multiparty risk: Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.

Software compliance/licensing: Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner&#x20;

## Vulnerability

> A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. Therefore, organizations need to regularly inspect for vulnerabilities within their systems.

### Vulnerability Types

&#x20;ProxyLogon: A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server. This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.

&#x20;ZeroLogon: A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol. An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person's identity. Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website's location.

Log4Shell: Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information. It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.

PetitPotam: Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.

Security logging and monitoring failures: Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it

Server-side request forgery: Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources. It can also allow threat actors to steal data.



## Threats Actors

> Who are the Threats Actors?

Government Sponsored

> Also known as “Nation State”.  They are well funded groups that carry out sophisticated large-scale attacks on behalf of governments to disrupt or compromise other governments.&#x20;
>
> They are not motivated by financial gain but rather national security, espionage, military intelligence or political influence.

&#x20;Terrorist Groups

> Adversaries who conduct violent acts explicitly designed to threaten or cause physical harm to individuals in order to achieve political or ideological gains.

Organized Crime

> Cybercriminals who are motivated by financial gain and target data (personal information, credit cards and banking information) that has a high value on the dark web.

Hacktivists

> Attackers who have an agenda to make a political statement.  They run high-profile attacks to distribute propaganda or to damage an organization they are opposed to.

&#x20;

Opportunistic Actors

> Individuals associated with unsophisticated amateur cybercriminal activity.  They are driven by financial gain or the desire for notoriety.&#x20;
>
> They are sometimes called “script kiddies” because of their inability to write their own code and must obtain scripts from other sources.

&#x20;

Insiders

> Internal actors that have direct access to sensitive information and knowledge of internal operations and processes.&#x20;
>
> Typically, are disgruntled employees or ex-employees who are motivated by financial gain or a grievance.
