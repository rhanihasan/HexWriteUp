# INFORMATION GATHERING

## <mark style="color:green;">Information Gathering</mark>

* Information gathering means collecting the information from whatever means necessary.
* It helps the tester to know more about the target system or network and plan the exploit.
* It's the sensitive steps in hacking.

> The building tester collect the information how the building is built and secured paint the building and it test the build with multiply ways like from Hammer to chemicals.

## <mark style="color:purple;">API (Application Programming Interface)</mark>

> A software (it can be anything like any game, any application etc.)
>
> The software is hosted an feature of authetication is enable (if someone wants to use/connect to softare it need to be authenticated by some credentials like username and password. >> A similar concept use by API where instead of credentials API use server generated Tokens based value, with token the software is accessable using API.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Assests Discovery</mark>

> A person will gather information about the target by observing the people the target interacts with. The term "victim asset" refers to the assets owned by the victim. This increases the vulnerability to attacks.

## <mark style="color:orange;">InReality</mark>

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:purple;">**Before dating a girl, a boy observes (Asset Discovery) the girl (the target) and her friends (the target people) to understand her daily interactions (Information Gathering). Through one of her friends (the target people), the boy knows the girl needs emotional support (information gathering). He then plans and creates a pickup/promises line (Exploit) to use it when the girl is in a bad time and emotional need (Vulnerability). If the girl is charmed/impressed (Initial Access), the boy aims to maintain the connection (Maintaining Access) with her (exploited connection) and seeks to identify emotional vulnerabilities (Privilege Escalation) to offer more support.**</mark>
