## SMTP

> **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** is a TCP/IP protocol used in **sending** and receiving **e-mail**.
>
> However, since it has limitations of queue/waiting  messages at the receiving end, it is usually used with  other protocols, POP3 or IMAP, These protocols allow users to save messages in a server mailbox and download them according . This combination of protocols is commonly referred to as a "draft."

> SMTP functions as a client-server-based protocol, enabling it to fetch and send emails. In other words, users typically utilize a program that employs SMTP for sending emails and either POP3 or IMAP for receiving emails.
>
> SMTP servers usually operate on ports 25, 465, or 587.
>
> The primary functions of an SMTP server include preventing spam through authentication and allowing authorized users to send emails.
>
> Most SMTP servers also support the protocol extension known as ESMTP with SMTP-Auth.

> When a user sends an email, the SMTP client (also known as the Mail User Agent or MUA) converts the email into a header and a body and uploads both to the SMTP server. The server, acting as a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA), checks the email for size and spam and then stores it. Sometimes, a Mail Submission Agent (MSA) is employed before the MTA to validate the content of the email, (Example: that the mail is genuine form client, the origin of the e-mail). ensuring its authenticity and origin. The MSA is also known as a Relay server. Correct configuration of these servers is crucial as many SMTP servers are vulnerable to Open Relay Attacks if improperly configured. This process works the same way for both the sender and the receiver.
>
> The MSA and MTA can be likened to a post office and are hosted on vendor servers, similar to how applications and software are hosted.
>
> On the receiver's server end, once the MSA and MTA processes are validated, the email is pushed or sent to the receiver's Mail User Agent (MUA) via POP3 or IMAP.
>
> When the client's mailbox receives the email, POP3 deletes the email from the server end. On the other hand, IMAP stores the original email on the server and sends a copy of the email to the client's mailbox
